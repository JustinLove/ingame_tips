# Ingame Tips

Tips and tricks to play the game, in context where possible.

## Features

- "Triggers" show tips when something relevant has happened.
- "Proofs" silence tips you obvoiusly know already.
- Advanced anti-nag technology avoids repeating tips too often.
- APM tracking tries to keep generic tips away from battles.

This mod is primarily beginner focused; experienced players will likely hit most of the proofs and few of the triggers, and may never see a contextual tip.

## Current Status

Effectively early access.  Many tips are missing triggers, and attention managment is completely untuned.

## Settings

Settings allow you to configure the main timing parameters and reset the tip stats for testing. The mod does not currently react to setting changes made from in-game, a UI refresh will be required.  If you reduce the repeat time, you may need to reset stats to clear previously set timers.

## Future Work

- Rewrite triggers and proofs with more readable helpers.
- Fill out triggers and proofs where possible.
- Extend the catalog.
- Highlight relevent UI buttons and features.
- Tune timing and attention management.
- Consider basing frequency on Spaced Repetition principles.
- Possible mod support for catalog extensions.
